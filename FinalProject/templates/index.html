         <h2>About</h2>
         <p>This project was made with the pourpose to make a beautiful UI with accessibility in mind, improving the UX
            for  all users.
            <br>
            For this project I made a Glassmorphism Website with the Back-End in Flask(Python) and MySQL as the Database. The Front-End is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            <br>
            The reason I didn’t use a CSS Framework(like Bootstrap) was because I felt that I would rewrite most of the pre-define UI Kit.
